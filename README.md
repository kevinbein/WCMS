# Windows Light/Dark Mode Switcher

This is a small powershell script that, when clicked, automatically switches light mode to dark mode and vice versa. 

## Usage

Clone/Download this repo and save the folder anywhere on your `C:\` drive where you have user access to, e.g.: `%USERPROFILE%\WCMS`. Then just execute `WCMS.lnk` once. This will a) change your them and b) copy `WCMS.lnk` to the taskbar folder. Afterwards you probably have to restart your computer to see the icon in the task bar. After that, just click the icon on the task bar whenever you want to switch themes. The icon in the taskbar will also change accordingly ;)
